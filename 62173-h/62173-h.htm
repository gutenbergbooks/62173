<h4>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Hermitage in the Woods.</i></h4>

<p class="sdc"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>, <span class="smcap">Launcelot</span> <i>and other</i> Knights.</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Launcelot.</i> Here is a place of prayer, we will alight,</p>
<p class="sm p1b">And rest a space and think us of our sins.</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Arthur.</i> Launcelot, and were I shrived and clean</p>
<p class="sm p1b">Half hell itself were loosened of its pains.</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Launcelot.</i> Arthur, friend and lover of my youth,</p>
<p class="sm">Could’st thou but throw this black mood from thee now,</p>
<p class="sm">And get a sweeter hope into thy soul,</p>
<p class="sm">Drive out the horrid phantoms of the past,</p>
<p class="sm">And it were hope for Britain. Well thou knowest</p>
<p class="sm">Men look to thee to succor this poor land</p>
<p class="sm">Enrent by inward brawls and foreign hordes,</p>
<p class="sm">Whose fields untilled, and vanished the smoke of homes.</p>
<p class="sm">It hath been said that thou would’st raise once more</p>
<p class="sm">Out of these ruins a kingdom whose great fame</p>
<p class="sm">Would ring for ages down the days of earth,</p>
<p class="sm">And be a glory in men’s hearts forever.</p>

<p class="sdr">[<i>Passes to the left.</i></p>

<p class="smf"><i>Arthur.</i> Launcelot, well know I thy love for Arthur.</p>
<p class="sm">’Tis thy sweet, manly kinship of the heart,</p>
<p class="sm">Opening thy spirit’s windows toward the sun,</p>
<p class="sm">Hath made my dark days lighter. Would that I</p>
<p class="sm">Had kept me holy, innocent as thee.</p>
<p class="sm">I might in kinder fate have made this land</p>
<p class="sm">A place where holiness and peace might dwell,</p>
<p class="sm">And such a white and lofty honor held</p>
<p class="sm">Before men’s eyes, that all the world would come</p>
<p class="p0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>
<p class="sm">And worship manhood’s beauty freed from sin.</p>
<p class="sm">Such dreams have haunted me from my first youth,</p>
<p class="sm">In fitful slumbers or long marching hours.</p>
<p class="sm">These lonesome lofty vigils of the heart</p>
<p class="sm">Have made men deem me colder. ’Tis my sin!</p>
<p class="sm p1b">Oh Launcelot I am blacker than thou knowest!</p>

<p class="sdr">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Launcelot</span>.</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Hermit.</i> And comest thou, my son, for Church’s grace?</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Arthur.</i> I come here, Father, for to have me shrived.</p>

<p class="sdr p0a">[<i>Kneels.</i></p>

<p class="smf"><i>Hermit.</i> Then thou art shriven, such a noble face</p>
<p class="sm">Could never harbor evil in its grace.</p>

<p class="sdr p0a">[<i>Lifts his hands in blessing.</i></p>

<p class="smf"><i>Arthur.</i> Stay holy Hermit, fair trees rot at heart,</p>
<p class="sm">And I am evil if this world holds ill.</p>
<p class="sm">I would lay bare my soul of its foul sin,</p>
<p class="sm">And if there be white shrift for such as me</p>
<p class="sm">In Heaven’s mercy, I would crave it now;</p>
<p class="sm p1b">Though little of hope have I, if thou dost hear.</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Hermit.</i> Wouldst thou confess, my son, the church hath power</p>
<p class="sm">To white the blackest sinner crawling foul</p>
<p class="sm">From earth’s most sensuous cesspool, doth he but</p>
<p class="sm">Come in the earnest sorrow of his heart</p>
<p class="sm">And lay his sins within her holy keeping.</p>
<p class="sm">But well I know that thou art that great Arthur,</p>
<p class="sm">The hope of all for succor to this realm:&mdash;</p>
<p class="sm">For other man hath never worn such grace</p>
<p class="sm">And nobleness of bearing as thou wearest.</p>
<p class="sm">Fear not my son, whatever be the sin</p>
<p class="sm">Of thy hot youth, the past will be forgiven,</p>

<p class="sm">In battle’s clamor only will it pass,</p>
<p class="sm">But in my <a name="TN009A" id="TN009A"></a>lonelier moments it comes in;&mdash;</p>
<p class="sm p1b">The awful memory of one heinous sin.</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Hermit.</i> Of truth thou hast suffered over much, my son.</p>
<p class="sm p1b">What is thy sin?</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Arthur.</i> One deed beyond all others of my youth.</p>
<p class="sm">Mad passionate and wild to savagery,</p>
<p class="sm">I violated a maid’s sanctuary,</p>
<p class="sm p1b">And afterwards, I found,&mdash;O Christ forgive me!</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Hermit.</i> Say on!</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Arthur.</i> She was my sister!</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Hermit.</i> Sancta Maria&mdash;Ora pro nobis!</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Arthur.</i> It will not out. The evil of that night</p>
<p class="sm">When I, unknowing, did that awful deed,</p>
<p class="sm">Hath blackened all my future like a web.</p>
<p class="sm">And when men look up to me as their sun,</p>
<p class="sm">It makes my life seem like some whited tower,</p>
<p class="sm p1b">Where all is foul and hideous hid within.</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Hermit.</i> Thou sayest truth, my son, thy sin be heavy.</p>

<p class="sdr p0a">[<i>Crossing himself.</i></p>

<p class="smf"><i>Arthur.</i> Oh swart, incestuous night whose bat-like wings</p>
<p class="sm">O’er-spread my life like thunder-gathering cloud,</p>

<p class="sm">Or wilt thou drag thy weary length along</p>
<p class="sm">And spell thy moments out in hopeless years</p>
<p class="sm">Until thy black o’er-laps the black of death</p>
<p class="sm">In that dread journeying where all men go,</p>
<p class="sm">When all my dreams are spent and smouldered down</p>
<p class="sm">Like some far ruined sunset at life’s ebb,</p>
<p class="sm">And hope deferred fades out in endless sleep?</p>

<p class="sm p1b">Thy blessed office naught availeth me.</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Hermit.</i> Nay son grieve not as one who hath no hope.</p>
<p class="sm">Though awsome be this youthful sin of thine,</p>

<p class="sm">There is a noble doom about thy face,</p>
<p class="sm">A writing writ of God that telleth me</p>
<p class="sm">That thou art not a common ordered man,</p>

<p class="sm">To wake this human summer-morn to life,</p>

<p class="sm">I saw it once within the Priestman’s face</p>
<p class="sm">The only and the last time I was shriven.</p>

<p class="sm">In this, Oh Launcelot, thou canst help thy king,</p>

<p class="sm p1b">Thou wilt do this and crown thy love for me.</p>

<p class="sm">Why stayed the king, unkingly, thus at home,</p>
<p class="sm">And sent forth Launcelot to meet his bride?</p>
<p class="sm">Oh Arthur, by my love, go forth thyself.</p>
<p class="sm">Rather thou sentest me sack a hundred cities</p>
<p class="sm p1b">Than do this deed that will un-king thee so.</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Arthur.</i> Launcelot, I would rather die than go.</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Launcelot.</i> Yea Arthur, I would rather die than go.</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Arthur.</i> Wilt thou honor me as a king?</p>

<p class="smf"><i>Launcelot.</i> Yea to the death.</p>

<p class="sso"><i>Arthur.</i> It is most strange. Relate the circumstances.</p>

<p class="sso"><i>Sir Mador.</i> ’Twas at the banquet, Sir King, where we all
invited of thy Queen, the Madam Guinevere, who sitteth
there, and after meat, she with much courtesy of seeming,
did press on us to partake of some fruit, the which on partaking
of, my brother, this dead knight, did fall in agony so
extreme and mortal, that his soul went out, and now he lieth

have a knight to prove her innocence by his body on the

Guinevere, Queen of Britain, I believe thee guiltless of the

I am not free to prove thine innocence with my body, but

ere the time appointed, I here condemn thee to be taken

<h4 class="text02 full">SCENE I.&mdash;(<i>Rise outer Curtain.</i>) <i>An Inn-yard in Milan.
Two</i> Burghers <i>discovered seated at a table, drinking</i>.</h4>

<p class="spf"><i>1st B.</i> Well, well, these be the strange days indeed, indeed!</p>

<p class="spf"><i>2nd B.</i> (<i>Rather drunk.</i>) How now, neighbor Burnard,
how now?</p>

<p class="spf"><i>1st B.</i> Heardst thou not the news, good Neighbor? But
with thy nose always i’ the wine-pot, thou canst not
know anything aside its rim.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>2nd B.</i> Wine-pot, wine-pot, thou sayst ha! ha! nose i’ the
wine-pot thou sayest, ’tis better than sticking it into
every business save thine own, hey! neighbor Burnard!
But what be this news that would keep the nose out o’
the wine-pot?</p>

<p class="spf"><i>1st B.</i> There be a new Pope at Rome, the Monk, Hildebrand.
How like you that?</p>

<p class="spf"><i>2nd B.</i> God, keep us all! Now thou dost say it! It
seemeth they be making new Popes every Michaelmas.
This were no reason for to keep the nose outside the
wine-pot. Here’s to his health, God save him!</p>

<p class="sp3l">’Twere a merry grape was squeezed for this, good
Neighbor. Here’s long life to thee an’ the Holy Pope,
and especially to the royal Henry. Soon may he come
to Italy.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>1st B.</i> It be said, Henry cannot sleep o’ nights i’ his bed,
for the making of this same Pope, Hildebrand, or
Hellbrand, as some folks call him. But hast thou
heard the greater news?</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p class="spf"><i>2nd B.</i> Nay, what now? Nothing be new now. Nothing
be new, along o’ fighting and preaching and lechering
and damning in the Church and State. Nothing be
new save drinking, and that be ever new. Ha! ha!
What else be new?</p>

<p class="spf"><i>1st B.</i> ’Tis concerning this same scarce-baked Pope, this
Hellbrand. ’Tis said he hath sworn by the mass and
all the saints never to rest until he hath unwived all
the priests i’ Europe. How like you that, good
neighbor Burnard?</p>

<p class="spf"><i>2nd B.</i> Ho! ho! ’Tis a good joke. Unwive the priests!
’Tis a good joke. ’Twere well for me and thee did he
swear a vow to unwive all the burghers i’ Milan.
’Twould gie one I know more peace i’ his bed o’ nights.
’Tis the priests ever have all the good fortune i’ Europe.
Ah me, ah me! ’Tis ever so.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>1st B.</i> Yea, but there’s more news yet, good Neighbor,
this same Hellbrand, which be a good name for him if
he be Pope, hath sent out two wondrous preachers,
endowed with uncommon powers of tongue and orders,
to spread this same doctrine in all Italy and throughout
Europe; an’ it be said they took fearsome oaths, on
pain of eternal damnation, not to rest till they had
done so; an’ further, ’tis said, they be here to-night to
preach i’ the market.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>2nd B.</i> I’ Milan?</p>

<p class="spf"><i>1st B.</i> (<i>Rising.</i>) Yea i’ Milan, here, i’ the square.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>2nd B.</i> Well now! It do be passing strange, well now!
It be a damn law, and he be a damn liar, who saith
not. A most unnatural law, for our good pastor.
Were it my case now, it were fitting, (<i>1st goes out</i>) who
taketh a lecture every midnight near upon cock-crow,
such as no Pope’s Bull could outwit in language an’
rhetoric. Say good Neighbor, what thinkest thou?
Might I not be made a priest? What be qualifications?
(Ha! he hath gone!) I could drink with an abbot,
yea, an archbishop, yea, I’ll see this same Hellbrand
about the matter: it shall be done, be done, ha! ha! it
shall be done. (<i>Reels out.</i>)</p>

<p class="sdc">(<i>Rise inner Curtain, the market place.</i>) <i>Enter several jolly</i>
Monks.</p>

<p class="smf"><i>1st.</i> (<i>Sings</i>) Ours be a jolly life,</p>

<p class="sm">And here’s to him, alack, (<i>all clench fists</i>)</p>
<p class="sm">Who’d turn him from his board and bunk,</p>

decretal preachers</i>. <span class="smcap">Arnulph</span> <i>ascends a pulpit to harangue
the crowd</i>.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Arnulph.</i> Know ye Citizens and Burghers of Milan, that
whereas in the past, by reason of evils and curses,
through the power of the Devil, Holy Church hath fallen
into abomination, to the shame of men and sorrow of
Heaven, it hath here now and at this time, behooved
her to cast off certain of those abominations, to wit,
especially that most heinous sin, whereby the priests of
the altar, do, without grace and carnally given, co-habit
in concubinage with those weaker vessels, even as do
the common and unsanctified of humanity; wherefore
know ye Citizens and Burghers of this city of Milan,
that the Holy Father doth now and at this time, by me
and through me, instruct you each and collectively, of
the dreadful enormity of this most damnable sin,
whereby the holy priesthood is made of none effect,
and Holy Church doth languish in weakness and vassalage
to the princes and lords of this carnal world,&mdash;know
ye,&mdash;</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p class="spf"><i>A Burgher.</i> Most reverend Doctor, cut ye short the
“know ye’s” an’ the “wherefores” and th’ “verbiations”
an’ the “latinities” an’ come down from your
high flown rostrum an’ tell us the church’s will. We
be plain men.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Other Burghers.</i> Well done, Big Gellert. Thou art in
the right of it. Bravo! Gellert.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Ariald.</i> Insolent Lump! would’st thou interrupt a doctor
of Holy Church?</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Gellert.</i> Holy Church confound him and thee, too, thou
sour-faced varlet! Who’s a talking of Holy Church? He
is but a stray rooster from some mad convent, an’ thou
his mate ranting on a mad doctrine. Holy Church
teacheth no such damned doctrine. Be we fools?</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Burghers.</i> Well hit, Big Gellert, thou canst give him the
latinities of it. Hit him back, old Pigeon!</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Arnulph.</i> Beware, thou impious Mountain of mortality,
an’ ye foolish burghers lest ye insult in me a power that
is behind me.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>A Clerk.</i> Come, come, get thee down, we want no such
strange doctrines. We have had clergy, good men
with wives and chicks i’ Milan, these centuries back,
an’ we be no Sodom.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Arnulph.</i> I know not your customs, but in the name of Holy
Church, I Arnulph, hereby command ye on pain of
deepest Hell hereafter, that ye abstain from all masses
made or performed by any priest who continues in this
unholy state, for I tell you be he priest, archdeacon,
bishop or archbishop, he is accursed, and doubly
accursed.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Gellert.</i> Thine be a big curse indeed, an’ by ’r Lady, thou
mouthest it well.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p class="spf"><i>Clerk.</i> Dost thou tell us our good pastor be in mortal sin
because he liveth with a good wife as do other men?</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Arnulph.</i> Have I not said it?</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Gellert.</i> Then art thou a brazen liar, an’ comest thou
down, I will give the non of it on thy brazen chops,
thou leathern-lunged Varlet of Satan.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Arnulph.</i> Dog of Hell, the arm that toucheth me Heaven
will wither!</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Gerbhert.</i> What meaneth this disturbance i’ my parish?
I thought I ruled a peaceful, God-fearing people, an’
not a brawling rabble.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Gellert.</i> Pray, good Father, ’tis yon loud-mouthed Dog of
Satan, hath insulted you an’ all Milan by his mad
heresy.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Gerbhert.</i> Insulteth me, good Gellert? (<i>To Arnulph.</i>) Who
are you who without my license come disturbing my
flock with thine unseemly harangues? Come down from
yon pulpit! (<i>To the crowd.</i>) Good People, in God’s
name, go home.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Arnulph.</i> Nay, I will not come down till I have delivered
this my message to this foolish mob, an’ to thee, thou
carnal-minded Priest. In the name of the Holy
Church I exhort ye,&mdash;</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Gel.</i> He saith, Pastor Gerbhert, that thou canst no more
make masses, being a wedded man.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Gerb.</i> (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Arnulph</span>.) Be this true?</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Arn.</i> It is true, by the Mother of God. An’ thou wilt feel
it too ere thou art an hour older.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Gerb.</i> Nay, Man, thou art mad, this cannot be!</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Gerb.</i> Then tell me Ariald, by our one-time friendship,
that this man be mad, an’ his message but a foolish
doctrine.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Ar.</i> Nay, Gerbhert, but ’tis thou art foolish, an’ this law
but too true, thou must obey.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Gerb.</i> Then will I fight this mad heresy, this inhuman
code. That we must give up our wives an’ babes, our
pure homes, an’ all that is holiest on earth! Nay, it
cannot be! ’Tis devilish!</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Ar.</i> But thou must obey or be driven out.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Gerb.</i> Ariald, thou knowest my Margaret, thou knowest
her sweet nature, her holy conversation. She hath no
devil, that her loving should make me unworthy.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Gel.</i> ’Tis damnable, good Father. But give me the word
an’ we will trounce them out o’ the market.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Brun.</i> How he doth take on, this new Friar Gerbhert.
I had not thought a man would lose his appetite for any
woman.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Wast.</i> Ah, Brun, you gluttonous men know not of love.
Such dangerous passions are beyond thy ken, lacking
the attractive, the magnetic, you descend to lower pleasures.
Now look on me a victim to woman’s fancy.
Within those walls I find a haven from woman’s importunities.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Brun.</i> Verily, Brother, thou must have slain hearts.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Wast.</i> It was my daily sorrow, so many beauties sought
me. I could not walk the streets, but I were pestered.
It did sorrow me much, I could not pity all the passions
I awoke, so fled me here, sacrificing my prospects,
my youth, my person, rather than light fires I
could not quench. (<i>Eyeing himself in a metal hand-mirror.</i>)
Alas, alas, Brun, my beauty falleth off sadly
of late.</p>

wonders me much where all thy provender goeth, it
doth thee so little service.</p>

tender reminiscences. But thou canst not touch my
feelings. Yea, Brun, didst thou but know the former
dignity, the port, the carriage of my person; the flash,
the majesty of my eye; the symmetry, the moulding of
my form; thou wouldst but marvel at this ruin I am.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Brun.</i> I doubt it not old Sucker, but let not thy former
beauty fret thy present comliness out o’ countenance.</p>

<p class="spf"><i>Wast.</i> Nay Brother, I will so endeavor, but I am ever on
the tremble lest some one of those former victims, in
cruel desperation maddened, may find me here and
seize my person. Brun, wilt thou protect me in such
extremity, wilt thou, Brother?</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p class="spf"><i>Brun.</i> Yea, that I will, thou Wreck of former perfection.
If any misguided person of that unfortunate sex be so
seized by distraction as to make formidable attack upon
thy classic person, she doth so on her peril, I promise
thee, old much-afflicted, my hand upon it. Be the
bottle finished? (<i>A knocking is heard without.</i>)</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
